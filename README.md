Description: 

A real-time collaborative document editor that allows multiple users to create and edit the same document simultaneously. The application uses WebSocket-based communication to synchronize changes instantly across all connected clients, ensuring a seamless collaborative editing experience.

The frontend is built with React.js to provide a dynamic and responsive user interface, while the backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO to manage real-time communication. Document data is stored persistently using MongoDB, allowing content to be saved and retrieved even after page refreshes. This project demonstrates real-time data synchronization, full-stack integration, and scalable collaborative application design.
